{"name":"pseudoAuth","body":"pseudoAuth\r\n==========\r\n\r\n**pseudoAuth** is a simple Ruby-based implementation of a pseudonymous authentication scheme between a client and a server. Using hashes, public and private key encryption and random challenge-response, a user is authenticated to the server, without actually revealing the real username.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nIn order to run **pseudoAuth** you need to have Ruby installed (I recommend v1.9.2). Other than that, some gems are required, too. You can install them like this:\r\n\r\n    gem install activerecord\r\n    gem install activesupport\r\n    gem install i18n\r\n    gem install activemodel\r\n    gem install arel\r\n    gem install multi_json\r\n    gem install sqlite3\r\n    \r\n\r\nDeploy\r\n------\r\nIn order to run, open two terminals. First run\r\n\r\n    ruby server.rb\r\n    \r\nand then\r\n\r\n    ruby client.rb\r\n    \r\nand you'll see some messages showing. That's it! ;)\r\n","tagline":"pseudoAuth is a simple Ruby-based implementation of a pseudonymous authentication scheme between a client and a server.
